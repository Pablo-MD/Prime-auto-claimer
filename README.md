# Prime-auto-claimer
If you are tired of the manual process of redeeming Twitch prime keys, this code will make your life easier.

# Prerequisites:
Right now it is set with the procedure that I have used. I want to expand this to be more generallistic generalist.
-Firefox, with the default profile logged in into twitch (because twitch restrict policy of using bots)
-Twitch Prime
-If you previusly linked you twitch account with a epic games account will be able to claim those games instantly
-Right now you will also need GOG Galaxy installed with your account for the games to be claimed.

I plan to make further imporovements and bug fixes. Also I intent to add the option of adding a .exe to more simplification. And the option of setting this code to windows schedule so it can be executed repetedly over a certian period of time.
